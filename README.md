# Data Solutions 
1. For question one, the most pc players gathered at eastern time zone and mountain time zone. In my case, i choose the eastern time zone cause the population distribution shows more people in eastern time zone. 
2. For players of dota, they gather at morning; for players of cs-go they gather at morning and lunch time; for player of pubg players gather in the afternoon and night. 
2.5 The possible explaination is for cs-go and dota, players play that before the class or work no matter win it or not; for pubg, players start the game after work or class and keep playing until they win. 
3. For question three, the time when most of players gathere at is the time for software engineers of the game comapny to pay attention. Otherwise the server might just crush. 
4. For question four, if i am the twitcher, i would choose cs go as my topic and broadcast from Wednesday to Sunday through lunchtime to the afternoon. In this time slot there are more viewers on twitch. 
5. For invester, moba and fps is more stable for investment, survival game have problems with its own survival. 

# How will i accomplish this task 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of one year value
3. Show player and viewer count of three games 
4. Form one week player count comparision
5. Form one week viewer count comparision
