# Analyzing the games

My research question is about games because i am a game lover. My orginal problems are will all the game players share the same habbits like me ( i play games 1am to 4am in the morning )? And if i got a few fund in my hand, should i invest the survival game because it's so famous for the past few years? 
My initial solutions are yes to these two problems. The suggestion for that is 1 to 4 am is the time slot when i saw most of friends either online or in game. Also, although the players of survival game is decreasing, it's still a hot game that has the potential for us to invest.

# Academic Question (into & broadside)
1. What games are most famous from the past year ( Briefly Describe ) 
2. What useful information can we extract from the data provided by steam ( if im game player, viewer, game company software engineer and investors) ?

# Academic Question (detailed)
These are the questions that i want to investigate
1. In which state gathered the most number of pc game players
2. What is moba, fps and survival game players' different habit about playing and viewing
3. When will the game company enhance the server ( one week data)
4. For a twitcher, when should they broadcast to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
5. For a invester, which game should they invest based on the trend ( one year data )

The reason why it is important to me is that i really want to know if every player of games shares the same habbit. It is my interest in. To reader, i want to prove them that even single dataset like viewer and player count can tell many stories for them to think, learn and even use for investment.

# Data Questions ( use the cs go as an example )
1. The most useful data for me is player and viewer count of different game. I found it through many source and finally choose steam chart as the data base (the steam provide a offical chart to calculate real time numbers of players and viewers ) https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/)

** Addtional Source That i Used when searching for the data

2. https://twitchtracker.com/statistics/games
3. https://sullygnome.com/game/Counter-Strike_Global_Offensive/30/summary
4. https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/

***webplotdigitizer is need to extract excel data from the plot

The reason why i finally choose these three games and these dataset is because they all come from the steam platform. It is official data and precise enough ( if steam tell the truth ). I really hope to have data from the league of legend, however, there is no offical data online and there is no third party provide the player data. If i given that data, i might broaden my comparison even in the same type of game. ( lol vs dota )

I think for metrics all the data should on the same timeline otherwise the comparison does not make any sense. All my data has changed into numbers. 

When i search the problem about in which state gathered the most number of players, i did use the research by another type of analysis. 

https://www.githyp.com/?type=steam-player-counts

This is the link that i found when i search for data. It shows the rank of most played and viewed games on steam if you are interested. 

# How will i accomplish this task 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of one year value
3. Show player and viewer count of three games 
4. Form one week player count comparision
5. Form one week viewer count comparision

# Data Answers (data visualization) 
1. In which state gathered the most number of pc players 

***https://news.yahoo.com/state-state-look-consoles-us-203852616.html 

For question one, the most pc players gathered at eastern time zone and mountain time zone. In my case, i choose the eastern time zone cause the population distribution shows more people in eastern time zone.

2. What is moba, fps and survival game players' different habit about playing and viewing ( one week data )

For players of dota, they gather at morning; for players of cs-go they gather at morning and lunch time; for player of pubg players gather in the afternoon and night. 

2.5 What is the possible explaination for this habbit? ( one week data )
![Alt text](https://github.com/ZIHAOLU1289/EN.663.667.01.FA19-Decision-Analytics-Fundamentals/blob/master/PLAYER%20COUNT%20ONE%20WEEK.JPG)

The possible explaination is for cs-go and dota, players play that before the class or work no matter win it or not; for pubg, players start the game after work or class and keep playing until they win. 

3. When will the game company enhance the server ( one week data )
*** Question 2 and 3 share the same graph 

For question three, the time when most of players gathere at is the time for software engineers of the game comapny to pay attention. Otherwise the server might just crush. 

4. For twitcher,what type of game should they broadcast and when should they start to broadcast in order to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
![Alt text](https://github.com/ZIHAOLU1289/EN.663.667.01.FA19-Decision-Analytics-Fundamentals/blob/master/VIEWER%20COUNT%20ONE%20WEEK.JPG)

For question four, if i am the twitcher, i would choose cs go as my topic and broadcast from Wednesday to Sunday through lunchtime to the afternoon. In this time slot there are more viewers on twitch. 

5. For invester, which game should they invest base on the overall trend ( one year data )

For invester, moba and fps is more stable for investment, survival game have problems with its own survival. 

# Academic answers 
1. The answer to the original question one is no. The players would not gather at the midnight from 1am to 4am. My conclusive answer for this is for most of the players they may just play the game whole night till tomorrow morning, and the other group of people like me wake up early would play one game before coming to the class. These two group of people would gather at the morning or lunchtime.
The answer to original question two is no too. From the trend we can know that players are begin to feel tired about the survival game. It is too late to invest the survival game. 

2. If i get more time, i would analyze more type of games rather the hottest three category. Many games on steam have a really idea for development and investment. 

3. For us in the real world, i really want to show everyone even simple dataset like viewer and player count of the game can bring us so many informations to think, learn and use for different ways of uses. 

4. For audiences no matter they want to be player, twitcher, software engineer or investors, i really hope my discovery might help them.
