# EN.663.667.01.FA19-Decision-Analytics-Fundamentals Problem 
1. What games are most famous from the past year ( all games ) 
2. Use steam as the main source, what is moba game (dota) first people shooting game (cs go) and survival game (PUBG) player and viewer's  habit ( one year data )
3. What useful information can we extract from the data provided by steam? 
3-1. Figure out when is the peak player time ( one week data) and why is that happened 
3-2. Is real time number of twitch viewers of steam game correspoding to real time number of game players ( one week data )
3-3. For a player, when should they start the game in order to match quickly & avoid waiting time ( one week data )
3-4. For a twitcher, when should they broadcast to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
3-5. For a invester, which game should they invest based on the trend ( one year data )

# What source is needed in my project/ links used for dataset ( use the cs go as an example )
1. The steam chart ( the steam provide a offical chart to calculate real time numbers of players ) 
   https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/
2. https://twitchtracker.com/statistics/games
3. https://sullygnome.com/game/Counter-Strike_Global_Offensive/30/summary
4. https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
*** for the viewer data, webplotdigitizer is need to extract data

# Data Question 
1. Analyze moba, fps and survival game players' different habit about playing and viewing ( one week data )
2. Analyze potential relationship between player and viewer ( one week data )
3. Amazing fact about player habit https://news.yahoo.com/state-state-look-consoles-us-203852616.html
3. For player, when is the best time for playing the game while not waiting long time for matching  ( one week data )
4. For twitcher, when should they start to broadcast in order to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
5. For invester, which game should they invest base on the overall trend ( one year data )


# How will i accomplish this task (data visualization) 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of one year value
3. Show player and viewer count of three games
