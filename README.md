# How will i accomplish this task 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of one year value
3. Show player and viewer count of three games 
4. Form one week player count comparision
5. Form one week viewer count comparision
