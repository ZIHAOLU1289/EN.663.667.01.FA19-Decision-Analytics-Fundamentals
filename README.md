# EN.663.667.01.FA19-Decision-Analytics-Fundamentals Problem 
1. What games are most famous from the past year ( all games ) 
2. What useful information can we extract from the data provided by steam? 

# Academic Question
These are the questions that i want to investigate
1. What is moba, fps and survival game players' different habit about playing and viewing
2. Is real time number of twitch viewers of steam game correspoding to real time number of game players ( one week data )
3. For a player, when should they start the game in order to match quickly & avoid waiting time ( one week data )
4. For a twitcher, when should they broadcast to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
5. For a invester, which game should they invest based on the trend ( one year data )

# What source is needed in my project/ links used for dataset ( use the cs go as an example )
1. The steam chart ( the steam provide a offical chart to calculate real time numbers of players ) 
   https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/
2. https://twitchtracker.com/statistics/games
3. https://sullygnome.com/game/Counter-Strike_Global_Offensive/30/summary
4. https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
*** for the viewer data, webplotdigitizer is need to extract data

2. Analyze potential relationship between player and viewer ( one week data )
*** Question 1 and 2 share the same graph 

3. Amazing fact about player habit

# How will i accomplish this task 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of one year value
3. Show player and viewer count of three games 
4. Form one week player count comparision
5. Form one week viewer count comparision
