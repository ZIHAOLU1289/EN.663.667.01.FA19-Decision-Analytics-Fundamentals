# EN.663.667.01.FA19-Decision-Analytics-Fundamentals Problem 
1. Briefly describe what games are most famous from the past year ( all games ) 
2. Use steam as the main source, analyze moba game (dota ) and first people shooting game (cs go) player and viewer count differece ( which game is more famous ) ( one week and one year data )
3. Figure out when is the peak player time ( one week data )
4. Is real time number of twitch viewers of steam game correspoding to real time number of game players ( one week data )
5. For a player, when should we start the game in order to avoid player waiting time ( one week data )
6. For a twitcher, when should we broadcast to gain the most viewers ( one week data )
7. For a invester, which game should we invest based on the trend ( one year data )

# What source is needed in my project/ links used for dataset ( use the cs go as an example )
1. The steam chart ( the steam provide a offical chart to calculate real time numbers of players ) 
   https://steamdb.info/app/730/graphs/
2. https://sullygnome.com/game/Counter-Strike_Global_Offensive/30/summary
3. https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
*** for the viewer data, webplotdigitizer is need to extract data

# Data Question 
1. The rank of most played and most watched game ( through sullygnome) just for overview, the main still would be CS GO & DOTA
2. The summary player count of all time of the past week of both games in one week 
3. The viewer count data of all time of the past week on twitch in one year
4. The summary player count of all time of the past week of both games in one year
5. The viewer count data of all time of the past week on twitch in one year
6. The peak data point and the overall trend 

# How will i accomplish this task (data visualization) 
1. Drag data from the steam chart and other source by webplotdigitizer, form into the excel sheet
2. Show the trend of value need 1&2&3 in excel chart
4. Form value needed 2 and 3 into in chart and find the relationship
5. Compare moba game player count and fps player game count to see if there is different trend of habit
6. Dig out the most useful information that audience might want to know
